Watch Me

# About
This webapp attempts to visualize the thought processes executed from self-performed therapy to restructure thoughts in case of impacted agendas.

##### Optional
A prompt is shown, and for those who provide the right inputs will be accessing a more personal modality. If you managed to answer correctly, but out of empathy, then you will be served indigestible data

# How it Works
1. Generalized archetypes are shown, select which fits you the most. This is merely a marker and is [for now] irrelevant to the rest of the features
2. A series of questions will appear and you must answer truthfully and with thought
3. After backend analyses, you will be directed towards perspective paradigms for which you must choose only one
4. Hereafter, you will decide how much of yourself to be watched. *The Eye* speaks once, then perennially watch so long as you give it what it wants to see.

# But why?
Again, this is originally for personal use, but to extrapolate my cause for anyone else it is to ensure your identity is of your own. Most of our experiences encounter extreme filtration, and forever they will be so long as they exist in the eyes of unreliables which includes your own.
